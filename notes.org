** Section 1: Welcome to the Course

8/21/2017

*** What is Deep Learning

+ Geoffrey Hinton - Godfather of DL. Check out youtube videos.
+ Artificial Neural Nets
  + Made up of nodes
    + Input Nodes - Input Layer (known values)
    + Output Nodes - Output Layer (values to predict)
    + Hidden Layer - Between input and output layer.
  + Input -> Hidden -> Output
  + Deep Learning comes in when there are multiple hidden layers.

*** Installing Python

+ Install Anaconda Python (version 3.5)
+ Launch Spyder through Anaconda Navigator

*** Getting The Dataset

[[http://superdatascience.com/deep-learning]]

+ Download Deep Learning A-Z Folder Template
+ Download the dataset for each part of the course
+ Look into Additional Reading mentioned throughout course

*** Plan of Attack
+ What we will learn in this section:
  + The Neuron
  + The Activation Function
  + How do neural networks work? (example)
  + How do neural networks learn?
  + Gradient Descent
  + Stochastic Gradient Descent
  + Backprogation

*** The Neuron

+ Basic building block of Artificial Neural Networks
+ Neurons by themselves are useless. With lots of neurons, they work together.
+ Dendrites are receivers of the signal and Axon is transmitter.
+ Synapses - Term for connector that passes signal.

+ Recreating on machine
  + Neuron (node)
    + Receives input (from input layer or other hidden layer neurons)
    + Generates output (to output layer or other hidden layer neurons)
    + Connected via synapses
  + Input Values
    + Independent variables
    + All for one single observation (one row in your database)
    + Need to be standadized (mean 0; variance: 1) or normalized (get values between 0 and 1)
      + Easier for neural network to process
  + Output Values
    + Continous, Binary, Categorical (several output values)
    + All for one single observation
  + Synapses
    + All assigned weights.
    + Weights is how the neural net works learn. By adjusting weights, neural net decides which signal gets passed along or not
    + Signals are sent into the neuron where they are added (weighted sum) of all input values and applies an activation function
    + Decision is made based on function whether signal will pass on or not
 
*** The Activation Function

+ Threshold Function
  + 1 if x >= 0 | 0 if x < 0 (yes or no)
+ Sigmoid Function
  + \(\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\) (used in logistic regression)
  + Smooth gradual progression
  + Very useful in output layer
+ Rectifier Function
  + \(max(x,0)\)
  + One of most used
+ Hyperbolic Tangent (tahn)
  + \(\frac{1 - e^{-2x}}{ 1 + e^{-2x}}\)
  + Can go below 0

+ Exercise 1
  + Assuming DV is binary (y = 0 or 1)
    + Threshold Function
    + Sigmoid Function (probability of y being 1 or not)
+ Exercise 2
  + In hidden layer apply rectifier
  + Output layer applies sigmoid function
