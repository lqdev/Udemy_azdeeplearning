*** What is Deep Learning

+ Geoffrey Hinton - Godfather of DL. Check out youtube videos.
+ Artificial Neural Nets
  + Made up of nodes
    + Input Nodes - Input Layer (known values)
    + Output Nodes - Output Layer (values to predict)
    + Hidden Layer - Between input and output layer.
  + Input -> Hidden -> Output
  + Deep Learning comes in when there are multiple hidden layers.

*** Installing Python

+ Install Anaconda Python (version 3.5)
+ Launch Spyder through Anaconda Navigator

*** Getting The Dataset

  + How do neural networks learn?
  + Gradient Descent
  + Stochastic Gradient Descent
  + Backprogation

*** The Neuron

+ Basic building block of Artificial Neural Networks
+ Neurons by themselves are useless. With lots of neurons, they work together.
+ Dendrites are receivers of the signal and Axon is transmitter.
+ Synapses - Term for connector that passes signal.

+ Recreating on machine
  + Neuron (node)
    + Receives input (from input layer or other hidden layer neurons)
    + Generates output (to output layer or other hidden layer neurons)
    + Connected via synapses
  + Input Values
    + Independent variables
    + All for one single observation (one row in your database)
    + Need to be standadized (mean 0; variance: 1) or normalized (get values between 0 and 1)
      + Easier for neural network to process
  + Output Values
    + Continous, Binary, Categorical (several output values)
    + All for one single observation
  + Synapses
    + All assigned weights.
    + Weights is how the neural net works learn. By adjusting weights, neural net decides which signal gets passed along or not
    + Signals are sent into the neuron where they are added (weighted sum) of all input values and applies an activation function
    + Decision is made based on function whether signal will pass on or not
 
*** The Activation Function

+ Threshold Function
  + 1 if x >= 0 | 0 if x < 0 (yes or no)
+ Sigmoid Function
  + \(\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\) (used in logistic regression)
  + Smooth gradual progression
  + Very useful in output layer
+ Rectifier Function
  + \(max(x,0)\)
  + One of most used
+ Hyperbolic Tangent (tahn)
  + \(\frac{1 - e^{-2x}}{ 1 + e^{-2x}}\)
  + Can go below 0

+ Exercise 1
  + Assuming DV is binary (y = 0 or 1)
    + Threshold Function
    + Sigmoid Function (probability of y being 1 or not)
+ Exercise 2
  + In hidden layer apply rectifier
  + Output layer applies sigmoid function

*** How do Neural Networks work?

Example: Property Valuations

+ Input Layer
  + Area
  + Bedrooms
  + Distance to city
  + Age
+ Output Layer
  + Price
+ Hidden Layer
  + Connected with input layer
  + Some weights will have 0 value and others will not
  + Allows you to increase the flexibility or your neural network and look for specific things

*** How do Neural Networks learn?

Not rule-based. Neural network deciphers answer by itself given the inputs and a structure

+ Single Layer Feedforward Neural Network (perceptron)
  + Input: \(x\)
  + Output:  \(\hat{y}\)
  + Cost function: C = \(\frac {1}{2}(\hat{y}-y)^2\) (most common)
    + What is the error that you have in your prediction
    + Goal is to minimize the cost function
  + Information is fed back through the network and weights are updated
  + Process is repeated with same observation until it converges
  + One epoch is when we go through a whole dataset and train our neural net on all observations
  + Cost function for multiple rows is \(C=\sum\frac{1}{2}(\hat{y} - y) ^ 2\). All rows share the same weights
  + Process of feedback is called backpropagation

*** Gradient Descent

+ How do we reduce the cost function?
+ The brute force method is to try out infinitely many weights to see which one is best. This is extremely inefficient due to the curse of dimensionality
+ Gradient Descent starts somewhere and look at the slope is positive or negative (down or uphill)
+ Then a "step" is taken and slope is recalculated to find out the next step using the new weight as the starting position

*** Stochastic Gradient Descent

+ Gradient Descent is a way to help solve optimization problem of minimizing cost function
+ However, Gradient Descent requires that the cost function is convex (parabola)
+ If the cost function is not convex, Gradient Descent finds local minimum instead of global
+ Stochastic Gradient Descent does not require a convex cost function
+ With Stochastic Gradient Descent, the weights are updated on an observation basis as opposed to the aggregate after processing all observations
+ Stochastic Gradient Descent allows you to avoid getting stuck at local minima
+ Stochastic Gradient Descent has greater fluctuations
+ Stochastic Gradient Descent is faster because all weights are not updated at the same time and data is not in memory
+ Gradient Descent is deterministic algorithm and Stochastic Gradient Descent is Stochastic
+ MiniBatch Gradient Descent method is a combination of both Gradient Desent and Stochastic Gradient Descent

*** Backpropagatio
